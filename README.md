Pieces
======

Pieces provides a simple but powerful framework for creating multiplayer games. It was born as part of a university project, in the spring term of 2007, involving the five authors listed below. The code was released as Free Software in January, 2010.

Future
======

Pieces has not been actively developed since the university project was finished in 2007. However, by recently making the source code public, the authors hope to gain some new interest in the project. If it turns out that there are some interest in using Pieces, it’s not unlikely that development will be resumed.
